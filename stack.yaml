# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
resolver:
  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/20/1.yaml
# enable the following line on developing(9.2.4 has hls full supported)
# compiler: ghc-9.2.4

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.

# - some-directory
# - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
#   subdirs:
